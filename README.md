# Varient Project Documentation

## Purpose
To learn more about what this product aims to achieve, please refer to product slides.

## Dev Environment
Some basic software and technologies need to be installed to edit, compile, and run the code.
``` sh
Node.js
``` 
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. This will enable us to run our API and back-end services.
- https://github.com/UT-Applicataion-Development-Association/Contribution-Guidelines#install-nodejs--npm
- https://nodejs.org/en/

``` sh
npm
``` 
- npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is installed with Node.js. It will be used to install various dependencies: libraries ranging from functionalities to styling.

``` sh
Expo
```
- Expo Development Client is used to run and test our code functionalities. Linking our codebase to this mobile app will allow real-time testing of features.
- https://expo.io/tools#client

``` sh
Postman
```
- Postman is an API client that makes it easy for developers to send requests to APIs and test responses. This will come handy when developing back-end functionalities.

``` sh
Git
```
- Git and Github will be used for repo version control. More on branching, commits, and code format later.
- More on this in our guidlines: https://github.com/UT-Applicataion-Development-Association/Contribution-Guidelines

``` sh
Editor
```
- VS Code or Webstorm is recommended, but feel free to use your editor of choice.
- More on this in our guidlines: https://github.com/UT-Applicataion-Development-Association/Contribution-Guidelines#install-webstorm

## Setup
``` sh
npm
```
After cloning the repository:
``` sh
cd ./Varient # change directory to ./Varient folder
npm install --add
```
 This should give you the necessary dependencies.

``` sh
Expo
```
Then, set up expo client in your local environment by running:
``` sh
# change directory to repository root folder
npm install expo-cli --global
```
This will set up your code to run/test front end on Expo Client app.

## Workflow

-  Tasks will be divided into phases, where the 1st phase will be completing the front-end and basic API functionalities. API and database will be completed in the second phase.
